            <h2 style="color: purple;">KABADDI</h2>
            <p style="color:blacks;">Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players each. 
                The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, tag out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath.
                 Points are scored tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. 
                Players are taken out of the game if they are tagged or tackled, but are brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.
                 It is popular in the Indian Subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries.

            <h2 style="color: purple;">CRICKET</h2>
            <p style="color: black;">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
                 The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
                  Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. 
                  When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. 
                They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p><br>
                <h2 style="color: purple;">BADMINTON</h2>
                <p style="color: black;"> Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
                    Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).
                     Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. 
                     Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
                     Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net.
                      Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.<br>
                      <h2 style="color: purple;">HOCKEY</h2>
                      <p style="color: black;"> Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. 
                        There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey. Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures.
                         In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where the game may have been called kerētízein or (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (kéras, κέρας).
                          In Inner Mongolia, the Daur people have been playing beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years. <br>
